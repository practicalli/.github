# Practicalli

Practical guides to programming in Clojure and tools that support an effective Clojure REPL workflow (Repl Driven Development).

[Practicalli Engineering Playbook](https://practical.li/engineering-playbook/) contains guides to a wider range of tools and practices within Engineering and Technical Management.

[Practicalli website](https://practical.li) provides a range of books to learn Clojure programming and detailed editor guides to support an effective workflow.
