Practical guides to programming in Clojure and tools that support an effective Clojure REPL workflow (Repl Driven Development)

[Practicalli website](https://practical.li) includes books on learning Clojure programming and detailed editor guides to help establish an effective workflow.

[Practicalli YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/practicalli) has over 100 hours of live coding in Clojure to demonstrate how to think in functional programming and apply Clojure to sovling challenges.
